## 🤖 Machine Learning Algorithms Used

### 1️⃣ 🧮 **Naive Bayes (MultinomialNB)**

**Concept:**

* Based on **Bayes’ Theorem** — assumes features (words) are independent.
* Best suited for text classification tasks like spam detection, sentiment, or emotion analysis.

**Why Used Here:**
🧠 It’s **fast, efficient, and interpretable** for word-frequency features such as TF-IDF.
**Formula:**
[
P(Class|Words) ∝ P(Words|Class) × P(Class)
]

### 2️⃣ 📊 **Logistic Regression**

**Concept:**

* A **linear model** that predicts the probability of an input belonging to a class using a sigmoid function.
* Despite the name, it’s a **classification algorithm**.

**Why Used Here:**
⚙️ Works well for **high-dimensional sparse data** like TF-IDF vectors from text.
It outputs probabilities that help interpret model confidence.

**Key Feature:**

* Uses **regularization (L1/L2)** to prevent overfitting.

### 3️⃣ ⚡ **Support Vector Machine (LinearSVC)**

**Concept:**

* Finds the **best hyperplane** that separates classes in high-dimensional space.
* Maximizes the **margin** between emotion classes.

**Why Used Here:**
🔥 Excellent for **text classification** — handles large feature spaces and sparse data effectively.

**Advantages:**
✅ High accuracy
✅ Robust to overfitting
✅ Works well with linear text features like TF-IDF
